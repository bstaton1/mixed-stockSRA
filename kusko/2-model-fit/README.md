This subdirectory contains all code for fitting the spawner-recruit models to empirical data from the Kuskokwim River. Because of the long model run times for state-space models, this code is intended to be ran on a high performance computing system, in particular one provided by the Alabama Supercomputer Authority. If desired, the code could be edited to run on an individual computer, or on another HPC - this is provided as an example of how it was done for this circumstance.

A mixture of shell (`*.sh`) and R (`*.R`) scripts are provided.
