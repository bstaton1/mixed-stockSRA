# Escapement and Harvest Data Preparation

This subdirectory contains the necessary code and data to perform the expansion of aerial survey index counts to total population estimates of escapement, as well as the reconstruction of harvests taken solely from the populations included in this analysis (not all tributaries that produce Chinook salmon in the Kuskokwim have been monitored for escapement, but still contribute fish to the mixed stock harvests).

An optional shell script (`0-run-analysis.sh`) is provided to run the entire analysis if desired, otherwise the R scripts may be executed one at a time.
