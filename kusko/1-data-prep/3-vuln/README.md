# Alternate Vulnerability Schedule Preparation

This subdirectory contains the code to calculate alternate vulnerability schedules for each population in the analysis. As an alternate way of calculating vulnerability (or the relative exploitation rates between populations), we calculated the average fraction of all fishing households within the Kuskokwim drainage that each population must swim past in order to reach its spawning tributary.

Fishing household data are available in Alaska Department of Fish and Game reports summarizing post-season subsistence salmon harvest monitoring, e.g., Hamazaki [(2011)](<http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/FMS11-09.pdf>), Carroll and Hamazaki [(2012)](<http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/FDS12-38.pdf>), and Shelden et al. [(2014)](<http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/FedAidPDFs/FDS14-20.pdf>).
